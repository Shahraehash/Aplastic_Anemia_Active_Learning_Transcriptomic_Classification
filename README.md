# Aplastic_Anemia_Active_Learning_Transcriptomic_Classification

Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder requiring improved diagnostic approaches. In this study, we plan on working with single-cell transcriptomic profiles from HSPCs and T cells of AA patients and healthy donors to develop a classification model using prominent active learning algorithms in the field. These algorithms strategically select the most informative samples for labeling, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data availability in rare diseases. We plan to compare these active learning strategies against a passive learning baseline, evaluating both classification accuracy and the number of samples it takes to achieve optimal accuracy. After developing these active learning strategies, we plan to examine the features or genes prioritized by active learning to develop the optimal model and compare those with traditional differential expression analysis, providing biological validation of our computational approach
